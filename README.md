1. Fizzbuzz Question

 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
 But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
 For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

2. Bubble sort

 Worst and average case complexity: O(N^2).
 This is due to the double loop which sorts N items each.

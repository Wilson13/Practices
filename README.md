1. Fizzbuzz Question

 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  
 But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.  
 For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

2. Bubble sort

 Worst and average case complexity: O(N^2).  
 This is due to the double loop which sorts N items each.  
 "This technique is called bubble sort or sinking sort because the smaller values gradually "bubble" their way upward to the top of the aaray like air bubbles rising in water, while the larger values sink to the bottom of the array. ""
